          <h3>Creating tomorrow’s solutions for today.</h3>
          <p>
            At SchoolerPro, we believe in creating tomorrow’s solutions for
            today. Education in India has always been a fast-paced industry
            where huge numbers are pitted against each other by institutions and
            upcoming EdTech Startups alike. We Beg to Differ. We are a platform
            that lets every teacher enhance her lesson and every student learn
            in a digital, real-world and scaleable way. Nature has already done
            a great job of already giving the kids a very plastic brain that
            just needs to be guided. We just have to keep feeding those guns and
            kids can imagine a world even better and smarter than us. <br />
            <br />
            Our logo emphasises our approach - Emphasise Application. Our logo
            is designed from a rather simple invention of a well known learned
            man. Pythagoras is so well known in India, thanks to his a^2 + b^2 =
            c^2 formula. In a poetically infamous way, this marks the single
            greatest rote-learned formula by many students in India. But
            Pythagoras is more than meets the eye. He loved the application of
            things with as much passion as he learned them. Our logo is based on
            a Pythagoras Cup. When filled under a certain level, the glass will
            hold its contents. Get greedy and fill more, it will empty
            everything with a vengeance, there is nothing one can do. Now, that
            is an application and that is why we love it - A fun, scientific toy
            that involves simple craftsmanship and takes a jab at a complex
            social problem of greed. That is high art. Which is what we want to
            be in the field of education.
